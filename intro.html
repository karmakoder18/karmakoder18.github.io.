          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Ayush Devani, and I am a Computer Science Engineering student at GSFC University. I am passionate about technology and its ability to improve our lives, which is what led me to pursue a career in this field. Through my coursework, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as C,C++,HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT, as well as gained knowledge in algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, and operating systems. I have also had the opportunity to work on various academic projects that have helped me develop skills in Programe, and I have applied these skills to personal projects outside of the classroom. In addition to my academic pursuits, where I have developed strong teamwork and leadership skills. When I'm not studying, I enjoy coding. I am committed to continuous learning and growth. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!"
